# Pull Request Practice

When a project is **_open source_**, that means anybody is free to use, study, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose. These permissions are enforced through an open source license.

The open source community provides a great opportunity for aspiring programmers to distinguish themselves; and by **_contributing_** to various projects, developers can improve their skills and get inspiration and support from like-minded people.

## Instructions

A friend of yours has created [this repository](https://github.com/The-Marcy-Lab-School/open-source-hello-world). 
They are a brand new developer and would benefit from your contributions. Their repository has **_a lot_** of typos, and grammatical mistakes in their `READEME.md`. 
They don't even use complete sentences sometimes! Futhermore, they have some bugs in their `helloworld.js` file.

Your job is as followed:
1. Fork [their repository](https://github.com/The-Marcy-Lab-School/open-source-hello-world).

2. Then clone down _your forked_ repository and make improvements to both the `READEME.md` and `helloworld.js` files. 

3. Commit and push your changes to your remote repository.

4. Finally, open a Pull Request so your friends has review (and hopefully approve) your changes.
