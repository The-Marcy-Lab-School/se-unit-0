### Optional Learning
So far, we've been working with Git and GitHub to improve our workflow as solo developers. Git(Hub) really shines as a tool for collaborative development. Explore the resources below to learn more about _branching_ and _merging_, the two concepts that GitHub collaborations rests upon.
