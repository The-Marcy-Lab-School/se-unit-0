# Introduction to the Command Line Interface (30 minutes)

## Objectives
FWBAT...
- Understand the origins of the command line interface
- Navigate their file tree using the command line interface
- Create, copy, delete, and move files and directories using the command line interface.
- Understand key file and directory naming conventions

## Vocabulary
* Interface
* Graphical User Interface
* Command Line Interface

## The Why?
* We are used to navigating our technology with an **_interface_** that is visually driven.
* Our normal interfaces use analogies that feel familiar from our everyday lives. We're used to clicking on "folders", saving files to our "desktop", we "scroll", "drag", and "move" images.
* These are features of a **_graphical user interface_**, or a GUI, for short.
* Before we had GUI's, we navigated computers using text commands.
* While GUI's are more user-friendly and easier to develop foundational proficiency, the **_command line interface_** is more _powerful_ and _efficient_.

* To this day, developers still use the command line interface because of it's ability to perform both repetitive and complex tasks with efficiency.
* How will we use the CLI? Installing software, interacting with software, manipulating your directory tree


## Guided Practices
Create the following directory structure:
   ```
   Lecture-1/
   |
   |-----teachers/
   |      |
   |      |--reuben_ogbonna.txt
   |      |--ann_duong.txt
   |      |--maya_bhattacharjee-marcantonio.txt
   |
   |-----hobbies/
   |      |
   |      |---indoors/
   |      |    |--BakingCookies.md
   |      |    |--WatchingTV.md
   |      |    |--Gaming.md
   |      |
   |      |---outdoors/
   |            |--running.txt
   |            |--walking-the-dog.txt
   |            |--hanging-with-friends.txt
   |
   |-----food/            
   ```

    - pwd
    - mkdir
    - ls
      - ls -a
      - ls -l
      - ls -la
    - cd
      - ~
      - .
      - ..
    - touch
    - mv
      - moving a file to a new directory
    - rm (-r)

  #### Advanced CLI commands that we can Google:

    - echo
    - cat
    - more
