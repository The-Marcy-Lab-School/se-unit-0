  - EC2

## What is the Cloud?

* Here's how Amazon define's cloud computing:
> Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, STORAGE, applications, and other IT resources via the internet.

* AWS is the global leader in **_cloud computing_** and it's not even close.
  * Microsoft, IBM, and Google are the closest competitor and AWS has more market share than all of them combined.

## The Why?
* Sometimes it's super convenient to have a standard type of computer all team members use.
* Cloud computing can offer more than delivery of extra storage. Its **_servers_** can deliver a whole **_virtual machine_**.
* We will be using AWS **_Cloud9_** as our development environment (linux).
* It's easy. It's cheap. It can be accessed from anywhere (as long as you have an internet connection). And it's more than enough to build a full stack application (and career!) on.

### Cloud9 and the AWS Ecosystem
* Cloud9 is a cloud-based **_integrated development environment (IDE)_** that you use to write, run, and debug code.
  * An integrated development environment is an application that provides all the tools you need for software development in one location. They include a terminal, a text editor, and a graphical directory tree.
* Instead of running your code on your physical computer, Cloud9 creates a virtual machine for your code to run on.
* Virtual machines are AWS most popular product. They offer them through a service called **_EC2 or Elastic Cloud Compute_**.
* Cloud9 and EC2 are just two of over 100 services that AWS offers to allow you to build software, secure it, and deploy it to the world.
